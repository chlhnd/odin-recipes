        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1 3/4 cups (225 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon (4 grams) baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon (1 gram) salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 cup (120 grams) walnuts or pecans, coarsely chopped</li>
                <li>2 large (100 grams) eggs, lightly beaten</li>
                <li>1/2 cup (113 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups (360 ml) (375 grams) mashed bananas (about 3 large ripe bananas)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon (4 grams) pure vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Banana Bread Recipe: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) and place oven rack to middle position. Butter (or spray with a non stick vegetable spray)
                     the bottom and sides of a 9 x 5 x 3 inch (23 x 13 x 8 cm) loaf pan. Line the bottom of the pan with a piece of parchment paper.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and ground cinnamon. Stir in the chopped nuts.</li>
                <li>In a medium-sized bowl combine the mashed bananas, beaten eggs, melted butter, and vanilla. With a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, lightly 
                    fold the wet ingredients (banana mixture) into the dry ingredients just until combined and the batter is thick and chunky. (The important thing is
                    not to over mix the batter. You do not want it smooth. Overmixing the batter will yield tough, rubbery bread.)</li> 
                <li>Scrape batter into prepared pan, smoothing the top with the back of a spoon. Bake until bread is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the 
                    center comes out clean, about 60 to 70 minutes. Place on a wire rack to cool and then remove the bread from the pan.
                    Serve warm or at room temperature. This bread can be frozen.</li>
            </ol>
